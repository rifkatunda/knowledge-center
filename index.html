              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Passionfruit plants in Uganda are affected by a range of fungal and viral diseases, which potentially cause high plant and yield losses. Accurate disease diagnosis of passionfruit diseases is essential for effective control. Disease identification is difficult, particularly for farmers that are new to the industry. This page provides information on the most common passion fruit diseases in Uganda.

                <h3>Woodiness Virus Disease </h3>
                <p>
                  This is a viral disease. Woodiness virus belongs to the group of viruses called potty viruses from viral family of potyviridae. The viruses are spread by aphids (green flies), where they feed on an infected leaf before they can spread the viruses to healthy plants. Aphids are not often seen on passionfruit. They land to feed, and then move through the crop. Pruning tools can also spread the viruses. The viruses are not spread through seeds.
                  The disease affects the plant at all stages from nursery to mature plants.

                      <li>Affected fruits become very hard like a stone and are usually deformed, shapeless, and undersized. Sometimes the disease makes the affected fruit crack.</li>
                      <li>Exhibition of yellowish distorted plant parts such as shapeless, small-sized, and clucked leaves. </li>

                    <li>Plant hygiene measures should be practiced, especially during training and pruning. Pruning knives should be sterilized by use of appropriate disinfectant, both before and after use.</li>
                    <li>Passion fruits should never be planted again in the same field or in the immediate vicinity particularly where a severe attack has occurred.</li>
                    <li>Control Mealy bugs, aphids, scales and white flies that may be vectors</li>

                    <h3>Brown spot Disease </h3>
                    <p>
                      This is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria passiflora. The disease affects the passionfruit leaves, stems, and fruit, it is triggered by a humid microclimate around the plant.
                      The produce of fungal seeds in large numbers on diseased plant parts lead to brown spot fungus spread. These spores are carried by wind or rain on to healthy leaves, laterals and fruit where they germinate and cause infections as well as the unpruned plants that grow under shades, fields that are established in the swamplands, and congestion in the nursery are very serious subject to brown spot attack.

                            <li>Circular dark-brown spots develop which later enlarge and from lighter colored central areas appear on leaves.</li>
                            <li>The fungus also attacks the fruits which develop brown sunken spots more or less circular in outline.</li>
                            <li>Laterals develop dark brown marks which may reach several inches in length. The marks often encircle the laterals and cut off the sap flow with resulting death of all parts beyond. </li>

                          <li>Pruning: This is the removal of unwanted branches from a plant. Pruning the vines is necessary to prevent the growth becoming too dense on the trellis, pruned vines dry out more readily after rain and also allow better penetration and movement of air that significantly assist in control.</li>
                          <li>Spraying: After pruning, the plants are sprayed with fungicides such as Antracol. Routine sprays should also be applied at monthly intervals during spring and early summer, and at two-monthly intervals thereafter.</li>

              <h3>Collar Rot Disease</h3>
              <p>
                This is a soil-borne fungal disease caused by the fungus, Fusarium solani.
                The rotting of the plant starts at the collar hence the name collar rot.
                The disease is most common in wet and cold seasons.
              </p>
              <div class="symptoms">
                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Appearance of cracks on passionfruit stems just above soil level after 10 months.
                      The cracks become larger and the diameter of the stem increases.
                      When the stem is cut open, grubs with black heads are seen inside short tunnels.</li>
                    <li>Purplish spots on the stem are early signs of the disease, as the rot progresses,
                      the lower part of the trunk becomes girdled, resulting in leaf and stem wilting. </li>
                    <li>Later, rots start from the tunnels, and destroy the collar region.
                      The rots cause the stems to break, but even if that does not happen,
                      the rots cause the leaves to turn pale green and fall, the branches to die back and,
                       eventually, the death of the plant.</li>

                  <li>Reducing water accumulation around the roots by planting in raised beds can decrease infection.</li>
                  <li>Ensure properly drained soils and Avoid planting in areas previously infected.</li>

             <h3>General Control Practices</h3>
             <p>
               Optimal disease control involves the prevention of infection, minimizing the inoculum (sources of infection), and breaking the disease cycle. These steps can be achieved by three essential control strategies: (1) canopy management, (2) orchard hygiene, and (3) a fungicide spray program.
             </p>

             <div class="symptoms">
               <h4> Canopy management</h4>
               Fungal diseases need extended wet periods for sporulation, spore germination, and infection to occur. Prune and open up the canopy to promote rapid drying,
               make the microclimate unfavorable for fungi, and avoid dense tangled canopies that trap dead leaves, which can be inoculum sources.<a style="display:inline" href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>
             </div>

             <div class="symptoms">
               <h4>Orchard hygiene</h4>
              Passionfruit plants are subject to infection by a variety of diseases throughout the year and minimizing inoculum sources by proper orchard hygiene is essential for effective control. Reduce sources of inoculum by:
              <ul>
                <li>Pruning out dead canes and leaves</li>
                <li>Remove prunings and diseased fruit</li>
                <li>Burn or compost infected plant material including rejecting fruit. Place the compost unit well away from cropping areas. The high temperatures that develop in properly designed compost units kill most plant pathogens.<a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a></li>
              </ul>
             </div>

             <div class="symptoms">
               <h4>Fungicide spray program</h4>
               A preventative fungicide program is recommended. It is too late to commence once symptoms appear.
               Fungicides are applied in accordance with the seasonal stages of the crop and the likelihood of infection by pathogens.

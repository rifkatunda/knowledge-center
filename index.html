              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Passion fruit plants in Uganda are affected by a range of fungal and viral diseases, which potentially cause high plant and yield losses. Accurate disease diagnosis of passionfruit diseases is essential for effective control. Disease identification is difficult, particularly for farmers that are new to the industry. This page provides information on the most common passion fruit diseases in Uganda.

                <h3>Woodiness Virus Disease </h3>
                <p>
                  This is a viral disease. Woodiness virus belongs to the Potty Virus group(PWV). The disease is spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids, mealy bugs, and mites, where they feed on an infected plants and then to healthy plants. Pruning tools can also spread viruses. The viruses are not spread through seeds. The disease affects the plant at all stages from nursery to mature stages. <a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Ensure the seedlings are sourced from a certified seller to avoid getting infected seedlings.</li>
                    <li>Plant hygiene measures should be practiced, especially during training and pruning. Pruning knives should be sterilized by the use of appropriate disinfectant, both before and after use.</li>
                    <li>Passion fruits should never be planted again in the same field or the immediate vicinity particularly where a severe attack has occurred.</li>
                    <li>Control Mealybugs, aphids, scales, and whiteflies that may be vectors.</li>

                      This is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria passifloracea. The disease affects the passionfruit leaves, stems, and fruit. it is triggered by a humid microclimate around the plant, this microclimate could be due to unpruned trees, trees that grow under a shade, fields that are established in the swamplands, congestion in the nursery.<a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>

Pruning the vines is necessary to prevent the growth from becoming too dense on the trellis, pruned vines dry out more readily after rain and also allow better penetration and movement of air that significantly assist in control.</li>
                          <li>After pruning, the plants should be sprayed with fungicides such as Antracol. Routine sprays should also be applied at monthly intervals during spring and early summer, and at two-monthly intervals thereafter.</li>

              <h3>Collar Rot Disease</h3>
              <p>
                This is a soil-borne fungal disease caused by the fungus, Fusarium solani.
                The rotting of the plant starts at the collar hence the name collar rot.
                The disease is most common in wet and cold seasons.<a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Appearance of cracks on passionfruit stems just above soil level after 10 months.
                      The cracks become larger and the diameter of the stem increases.
                      When the stem is cut open, grubs with blackheads are seen inside short tunnels.
                    </li>
                    <li>Purplish spots on the stem are early signs of the disease, as the rot progresses,
                      the lower part of the trunk becomes girdled, resulting in leaf and stem wilting. </li>
                    <li>Later, rots start from the tunnels and destroy the collar region. The rots cause the stems to break, but even if that does not happen, the rots cause the leaves to turn pale green and fall, the branches to die back and, eventually, the death of the plant..</li>

                        The virus is not apparently transmitted by seeds. Diabrotics speciosa, a polyphagous beetle, found occasionally in passion flower plantations is the natural vector of PaYMV.<a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>

                              <p>
                                Fusarium wilt is serious fungal disease in Passion fruit particularly the local purple passion fruits. The disease is soil borne, meaning that the fungus lives in the soil from where it attacks the rooting system of the plants. 
                                Inside an orchard, it is spread by soil movements by running water or irrigation water. 
                                The disease intensity is greater in sandy soils and favoured by high temperatures and relative humidity,
                                spreading upwards along the stem and one can easily recognize brown patches scattered on the stem. <a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>

                                Pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. passiflorae, an aerobic gram-negative rod which forms bright yellow colonies in the culture medium is the causative agent
                                Infection occurs through natural openings; Disease severity increases with high temperatures and relative humidity. Local dissemination of the bacterium is favoured by wind, rain, irrigation and also through infected seedlings.

                                    <li>Diseased plant show well defined translucent, dark green anasarcous small spots encircled by a chlorotic halo on the leaves. 
                                        Under favourable conditions, lesions become bigger and turn brown in colour affecting the entire leaf causing wilt and leaf fall.</li>
                                    <li>On latter stages infection spreads through leaf veins to reach the vascular system of the vines, causing longitudinal grooves, 
                                        darkening of the vascular systems and portion dry. Incidence of this disease greatly reduces fruit production and eventually causes death of plant.</li>
                                    <li>Fruits are presented with dark or brownish green, anasarcous circular or irregular lesions with well-defined edges. Bacterial exudates
                                        when dry form a hard crust over the lesions. These spots penetrate the pulp, causing fruits to fall before maturation or making fruits unmarketable.</li>

                                    The preventive measures that can be adopted to control bacterial spot include;
                                  </p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li>Seeds and seedlings should be taken from healthy plants of disease-free areas. Seed thermal therapy at 50˚C for 
                                    15 minutes is efficient to eliminate pathogen without affecting germination of seeds.</li>
                                  <li>Use adequate amount of nitrogenous fertilizers, especially stimulates new shootings and delays maturation, making plants more susceptible
                                     to bacterium. The elimination of diseased parts of the plants and disinfection of pruning tools and hands with bactericide products, such as those using quaternary ammonium and alcohol may reduce the spread of pathogen.</li>
                                  <li>Copper oxychloride and its mixture with mancozeb at 7 to 15 days interval decrease the intensity of disease. However, under frequent rains and favourable environmental conditions of pathogens the use of fungicides 
                                    highly soluble in water is washed away by rain. If there is no rain or no sprinkler irrigation, the product shows effective protection.</li>

                       <h3>General Control Practices</h3>
                         <p>
                           Optimal disease control involves the prevention of infection, minimizing the inoculum (sources of infection), and breaking the disease cycle. These steps can be achieved by three essential control strategies: (1) canopy management, (2) orchard hygiene, and (3) a fungicide spray program.<a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>
                         </p>

             <div class="symptoms">
               <h3>Canopy management</h3>
               <p>Fungal diseases need extended wet periods for sporulation, spore germination, and infection to occur. Prune and open up the canopy to promote rapid drying,
               make the microclimate unfavorable for fungi, and avoid dense tangled canopies that trap dead leaves, which can be inoculum sources.<a style="display:inline" href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a>

               </div>

             <div class="symptoms">
               <h3>Orchard hygiene</h3>
               <p>Passionfruit plants are subject to infection by a variety of diseases throughout the year and minimizing inoculum sources by proper orchard hygiene is essential for effective control. Reduce sources of inoculum by:
               </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pruning out dead canes and leaves</li>
                <li>Remove prunings and diseased fruit</li>
                <li>Burn or compost infected plant material including rejecting fruit. Place the compost unit well away from cropping areas. The high temperatures that develop in properly designed compost units kill most plant pathogens.<a href="#rheinlander"> [1]</a></li>
              </ul>
             </div>

             <div class="symptoms">
               <h3>Fungicide Spray Program</h3>
               <p>A preventative fungicide program is recommended. It is too late to commence once symptoms appear. Fungicides are applied following the seasonal stages of the crop and the likelihood of infection by pathogens.</p>

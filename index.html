                Passionfruit plants in Uganda are affected by a range of fungal and viral diseases, which potentially cause high plant and yield losses. Accurate disease diagnosis of passionfruit diseases is essential for effective control. Disease identification is difficult, particularly for farmers that are new to the industry. This document provides information on the most common passion fruit diseases in Uganda.

            <h3>Woodiness Disease </h3>
            <p>
              This is a viral disease. Woodiness virus belongs to the group of viruses called potty viruses from viral family of potyviridae. The viruses are spread by aphids (green flies), where they feed on an infected leaf before they can spread the viruses to healthy plants. Aphids are not often seen on passionfruit. They land to feed, and then move through the crop. Pruning tools can also spread the viruses. The viruses are not spread through seeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              The disease affects the plant at all stages from nursery to mature plants.

                <li>The disease is visible on leaves as a light or dark green mosaic pattern often with light yellow discoloration.</li>
                <li>Affected fruits become very hard like a stone and are usually deformed, shapeless, and undersized. Sometimes the disease makes the affected fruit crack.</li>
                <li>Exhibition of yellowish distorted plant parts such as shapeless, small-sized, and clucked leaves. </li>
